MeetFAQ is a tool to convert private communication into public knowledge.<br />
The entire project is built under [NX](https://nx.dev/) to have a monorepo with multiple projects.<br /><br />
Unlike other NX project, this project has one `.env` file that is shared between all the apps.<br />
It makes it easier to develop and deploy the project.<br /><br />
When deploying to websites like [Railway](https://railway.app) or [Heroku](https://heroku.com), you can use a shared environment variables for all the apps.<br /><br />

**At the moment it has 5 project:**

- **Backend** - NestJS based system
- **Website** - NextJS based control panel and multi-tenant website.
- **Discord** - NestJS based Discord bot.
- **Marketing** - NextJS based marketing website.
- **Docs** - Mintlify based documentation website.

## Architecture
### Backend
The project has a centralized backend that both the bots and the client interact with.<br />
The backend is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) with a basic architecture of controllers, services, repositories and dtos.<br /><br />
It uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM to interact with the database.<br />
By default Prisma uses [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database, but it can be easily changed to any other database since there are no native queries.<br /><br />
The project doesn't have a control panel login, it works with an SSO using the different bots.<br />
Once somebody uses a command like `/add` or `/signin` the backend will receive the server id and the internal user id from the bot.<br /><br />
The backend will auto-create an organization and a user if it doesn't exist.<br />
It will return a URL with the JWT token embedded in the url to sign in into the control panel.

### Frontend
The frontend is built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).<br />
The user joins the control panel with the URL generated by the backend in the URL.<br />
It will register it to the cookies and remove it from the URL for security reasons.<br />
The Frontend has 3 main pages:
- The main control panel to create and manage the FAQ.
- A "create an faq" page, it takes an entire conversation and converts it into an FAQ with OpenAI ChatGPT.
- The multi-tenant website for each customer with their own subdomain - to achieve that we use Vercel apex domain.<br />
We rewrite every wildcard subdomain or domain to `/c/domain` with Next.JS middleware to achieve static generation.<br />
For example: `nevo.meetfaq.com` will be rewritten to `/c/nevo.meetfaq.com` and will be statically generated.

### Discord
The Discord bot is built with [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/).<br />
It runs in a loop and listens to every message in every server it's in.<br />
Once somebody runs a command such as `/add` or `/signin` it will send a request to the backend with the server id and the user id.<br />
This is a simple server and in the future there will be many other bots for different platforms.

### Marketing
The marketing website is built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).<br />
It's a simple static websites with a few pages.

### Docs
The documentation website is built with [Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/).<br />
The reference in the documentation is being auto-generated by the backend.<br />
NestJS has a built-in Swagger module that generates a JSON file with all the routes and their documentation.<br />
It makes it very easy to track API changes and deploy them.
